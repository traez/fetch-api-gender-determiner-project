# Section.io - Fetch API Gender-Determiner Beginner Project

This is a beginner project solution to get familiar with the use of Fetch API [This YouTube tutorial was most useful out of several](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmGmLFcukM). I am trying to improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Type a name and then get data from the Genderize API to populates fields in the HTML page and confirm likely gender of chosen name.  
- See error response if name input is not acceptable.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript using Fetch API

### What I learned

Biggest takeaway from building this project was adopting "Separation of concerns" or "Single Responsibility Principle" part of the SOLID code writing principles. The codebase has 4 functions. Old me would have probably left everything in 1 function. Lols.  

### Continued development

Learn and build more API based projects.
