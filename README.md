# Section.io - Digital Clock and Countdown Timer JavaScript Project on JS Beginners

This is a combined solution to the [Digital Clock](https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-digital-clock/) and [Countdown Timer JavaScript Project](https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-countdown-timer/). I am trying to improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

- The objective of this project is to code a JavaScript digital clock. This is a basic clock that displays the local time on your local computer.
- As trivia, project also returns days left ti Nigeria's 2023 Presidential elections.
- The project creates a JavaScript countdown timer. This timer takes a given day and returns the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until said day.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- This was my longest Javascript project by far. Almost 200 lines on VsCode! Admittedly it is a double intermediate project combined in one.  
- Extensively getting familiar with Javascript date Object.  
- More Single-Responsibility-Principle code architecture learnings.    
- Yet came to respect ChatGPT the more. It has got me super productive!  

### Continued development

More practice; continuously and consistently!
